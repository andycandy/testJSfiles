# Gemini API: Get started with image generation
*/

/* Markdown (render)
The `imagen-3.0-generate-002` model is Google's highest quality text-to-image model, featuring a number of new and improved capabilities. Imagen 3 can do the following:

* Generate images with fine detail, rich lighting, and few distracting artifact
* Understand prompts written in natural language
* Generate images in a wide range of formats and styles
* Render text effectively

This notebook is using the [Python SDK](https://googleapis.github.io/python-genai/#imagen). For the REST API, check out the [Get Started with Imagen](../Get_started_imagen_rest.ipynb) guide.

## Setup
### Install SDK

Install the SDK from [npm](https://github.com/googleapis/js-genai)/[cdn](https://esm.sh/@google/genai@1.4.0).
*/

// [CODE STARTS]
const module = await import("https://esm.sh/@google/genai@1.4.0");

// [CODE ENDS]

/* Output Sample

Machine learning is a type of artificial intelligence that allows computer systems to learn from data without being explicitly programmed. It involves algorithms that can improve their performance on a specific task over time as they are exposed to more data.

*/

### Initialize SDK client

With the new package you now only need to initialize a client with you API key (or OAuth if using [Vertex AI](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai)). The model is now set in each call.
*/

// [CODE STARTS]
GoogleGenAI = module.GoogleGenAI;
ai = new GoogleGenAI({ apiKey: process.env.GEMINI_API_KEY });
// [CODE ENDS]

/* Markdown (render)
## Generate images
### Select model

The model you will use is `imagen-3.0-generate-002`.
*/

// [CODE STARTS]
MODEL_ID = "imagen-3.0-generate-002"
// [CODE ENDS]

### Prompt creation

Now, write your prompt and set some optional parameters. The `imagen-3.0-generate-002` model is trained on long captions and will provide better results for longer and more descriptive prompts. Note that if you use a short prompt, it may result in low adherence and more random output.

Check the [prompt guide](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/imagen-prompt-guide) for more advice on creating your prompts.

Here are the parameters you can set relating to your prompt:
* `number_of_images`: Specifies how many iamges will be generated. The default value is 4, with valid values between 1 to 4, inclusive. In the below code cell, `sample_count` is used to define this.
* `person_generation`: Allows the model to generate images with adults. Kids are always blocked. The supported values are `DONT_ALLOW` and `ALLOW_ADULT`. The default value is `ALLOW_ADULT`.
* `aspect_ratio`: Specifies the aspect ratio of the images produces. The supported values are `1:1`, `3:4`, `4:3`, `16:9`, and `9:16`. The default value is `1:1`.
* `output_mime_type`: The output type of your image, which will be `image/jpeg`. This is the only allowed value at the moment.

A non-visible digital [SynthID](https://deepmind.google/technologies/synthid/) watermark is always added to generated images.

*/

// [CODE STARTS]
prompt = "A cat lounging lazily on a sunny windowstill playing with a kid toy."
number_of_images = 4
personGeneration = "ALLOW_ADULT"
aspectRatio = "1:1"
// [CODE ENDS]

/* Markdown (render)
### Generate the images
*/

// [CODE STARTS]
const response = await ai.models.generateImages({
    model: 'imagen-3.0-generate-002',
    prompt: prompt,
    config: {
        numberOfImages: 4,
        aspectRatio: aspectRatio,
        personGeneration: personGeneration
    },
});

// [CODE ENDS]

/* Markdown (render)
### Display the images

Use the code below to inspect the images you generated.
*/

// [CODE STARTS]
for (const generatedImage of response.generatedImages) {
    const base64 = generatedImage.image.imageBytes;
    console.image(base64, "image/png");
}
// [CODE ENDS]

## Next Steps
### Useful documentation references:

To improve your prompting skills, check the [prompt guide](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/imagen-prompt-guide) for great advices on creating your prompts.

### Check those cool Imagen examples:
Here are some Imagen examples to get your imagination started on how to use it in creative ways:
*  [Illustrate a book](../examples/Book_illustration.ipynb): Use Gemini and Imagen to create illustration for an open-source book

### Continue your discovery of the Gemini API

Gemini is not only good at generating images, but also at understanding them. Check the [Spatial understanding](./Spatial_understanding.ipynb) guide for an introduction on those capabilities, and the [Video understanding](./Video_understanding.ipynb) one for video examples.
